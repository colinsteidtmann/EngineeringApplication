My name is Colin Steidtmann, I am 16 years old, and here is what I have been working on every day for the past year. 
``NeuralNets`` contains the fully connected, convolution, and general Neural Network File
``SolvingOpenAiEnvironments`` contains code to solve cartpole, pendulum, mountaincar (not working at the moment), and pacman using the neural networks I built.
``RandomFiles`` has a ton of random trial and errors and files I created along my journey
``ApproximatingSine`` was the first thing I tried to do, I worked on creating a feedforward neural network that would approximate the sine wave
``Mnist`` has files to classify handwritten digits.

run "Mnist/mnist_classifier.py" to classify handwritten digits
run "SolvingOpenAiEnvironments/cartpole.py" to solve OpenAi cartpole environment using DQN
run "SolvingOpenAiEnvironments/pendulum.py" to solve OpenAi continous pendulum environment using A2C, Actor-Critic
run "SolvingOpenAiEnvironments/pacman.py" to solve OpenAi atari pacman environment using A2C, Actor-Critic, CNN
